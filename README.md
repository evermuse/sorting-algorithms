Implement Five Different Sorting Algorithms [bubble sort • quick sort • merge sort • insertion sort • selection sort]

# Bubble Sort

Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)

-O(n2) worst case performance
-O(n2) average performance

# Quick Sort

Efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)

-O(n2) worst case performance
-O(n log n)avergage performance

# Merge Sort

Mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)

-O(n log n) worst case / avg performance

# Insertion Sort

 Simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)

 -O(n2) worst case

 # Selection Sort

 Divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted, which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list.

 -O(n2) worst case
